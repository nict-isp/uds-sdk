Welcome to User-defined Sensor SDK
==================================

This document explains how to use the User-Defined Sensor SDK (UDS SDK).

By moving on to the :doc:`intro/installation` and :doc:`intro/tutorial/index` sections,
you can immediately start building sensors with the UDS SDK.
To learn more about how to implement the sensors that meet your particular needs,
see the :doc:`topics/sensors/index` section.
For even more detailed information on using the UDS SDK,
see the later topics in the *User's Guide*.

Finally, you can read about detail specifications of the UDS SDK and its output data formats
in the :doc:`refs/api` and the :doc:`refs/m2m/index` section.
